# 'Sheep' Development Example Task

### Requirements
The specification of what is required is as follows:

1) Create a field in which to add sheep
2) You must be able to name and add a sheep into the field, each as a male or female
3) You must be able to brand a sheep at random (paint it green) that is currently living in the field
4) You must encourage two random sheep to breed and if successful, spawn a new sheep into the field

Logic that must be factored in:

1) The probability of a female sheep giving birth after mating is 50%
2) Branded sheep must be highlighted in green
3) Branded sheep are not able to breed
